# Parking-Slot-Detection-System-Using-MATLAB
The project is a MATLAB-based application that uses image processing techniques to detect and count available parking spaces in a parking lot. It displays vacant spots and demonstrates the potential of automated parking management systems, which can work with live camera feeds for real-time monitoring.
